                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Bethany received the recipe for this delicious apple pie from her grandmother. At the age of 5, she was already baking this old-American traditional apple pie at her home. As the recipe goes a long way back, it contains the most typical ingredients used for so many years to make this classic even today, one of our most popular pies.</p>
                <p>This pie is available every day and comes in 2 sizes. <span class="highlight-text">You can serve it cold or warm it for 4 minutes in the microwave to give it an extra touch.</span> Your house will smell just like Bethany's Shop!</p>
                <p class="small-note">Note that some ingredients may be dangerous if you have certain allergies. See the list of ingredients below.</p>
                <p class="small-note">Bethany cares about the environment and we try to limit our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as much as possible. See our home page for more info.</p>

                <h2>How we make this pie</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, we combine sugar, flour and spices. We toss the apples with some lemon juice and add sugar.</li>
                    <li>We then create the bottom crust and fill that with apple mixture. We put some butter on that. We then roll remaining crust to fit top of pie.</li>
                    <li>Then we beat the eggs white until we have a foamy mix. That is then brushed over the crust. We sprinkle some extra sugar.</li>
                    <li>Then the pie goes into the oven at 350° for 35 minutes. When ready, we let it cool on a wire rack.</li>
                    <li>If something goes wrong, we start all over again!</li>
                </ol>
